			The filter type to use.

			RT
			The RT (ray tracing) filter is a generic ray tracing denoising filter which 
			is suitable for denoising images rendered with Monte Carlo ray tracing methods 
			like unidirectional and bidirectional path tracing. It supports depth of field 
			and motion blur as well, but it is not temporally stable. The filter is based 
			on a deep learning based denoising algorithm, and it aims to provide a good 
			balance between denoising performance and quality for a wide range of samples 
			per pixel.

			It accepts either a low dynamic range (LDR) or high dynamic range (HDR) color 
			image as input. Optionally, it also accepts auxiliary feature images, e.g. 
			albedo and normal, which improve the denoising quality, preserving more details 
			in the image.

			The RT filter has certain limitations regarding the supported input images. Most 
			notably, it cannot denoise images that were not rendered with ray tracing. 
			Another important limitation is related to anti-aliasing filters. Most renderers 
			use a high-quality pixel reconstruction filter instead of a trivial box filter 
			to minimize aliasing artifacts (e.g. Gaussian, Blackman-Harris). The RT filter 
			does support such pixel filters but only if implemented with importance sampling. 
			Weighted pixel sampling (sometimes called splatting) introduces correlation 
			between neighboring pixels, which causes the denoising to fail (the noise will 
			not be filtered), thus it is not supported.

			RTLightmap
			The RTLightmap filter is a variant of the RT filter optimized for denoising HDR 
			lightmaps. It does not support LDR images.
